## Question 1
# Return frequency of v in L[start:stop].
# The worst-case run time is:
# Because:
def getFrequency(v, L, start, stop):
    L_sub = L[start:stop]
    n = 0
    for el in L_sub:
        if el == v:
            n += 1
    return n


# Question 1 Answer
# The worst-case run time which we list all the element from L[start:stop], which we have O(stop-start)


## Question 2
# Return majority element of L if it exists, otherwise 'False'.
# The worst-case run time is:
# Because:
def getMajorityNaively(L):
    for v in L:
        if getFrequency(v, L, 0, len(L)) > len(L) // 2:
            return v
    return False


# Question 2 Answer
# The worst case which is we have to review all the element until the end of L and check whether this element is the majority element or not
# which gave us the complexity of O(n^2) where n is the length of L


## Question 3
# Return majority element of L if it exists, otherwise 'False'.
# The worst-case run time is:
# Because:
def getMajorityDaC(L):

# Question 3 Answer
# For the recursive complexity which is C(n) <= 2C(n/2)+cn, by applying the master theorem we have the complexity following
# The worst case complexity is O(nlogn) where n is the length of L


## Question 4
# Return majority element of M if it exists, otherwise 'False'.
# The worst-case run time is:
# Because:
def getMajorityInMatrixDaC(M):

        right_MajorityFreq = getFrequencyFromMatrix(right_Majority, M,
                                                    rowStart, rowStop,

# Question 4 Answer
# The algorithms implemented in question 4 which is exactly the same with in quesiton 3
# Since the size of the matrix which is n=2^k*2^k, Therefore, the complexity of the algorithm is O(nlogn) where n is the size of the matrix


# Returns the frequency of v in M[rowStart:rowStop][colStart:colStop].

## Question 5
# Return majority element of L if it exists, otherwise 'False'.
# The worst-case run time is:
# Because:
def getMajorityBoyerMoore(L):
    # initialization
    freq = 0

            freq -= 1
        else:
            freq += 1
    # justify whether curr is the majority of list or not
    if getFrequency(curr, L, 0, len(L)) > len(L) // 2:
        return curr
    return False


# Question 5 Answer
# For the first part of the algorithms, we have to view all the elements in the list which gave us the complexity of C(n)
# For the second part we check whether is majority, which in the wrost case we have C(n) computation
# Therefore we have the complexity that 2C(n) = O(n)


## Question 6
# Return majority element of L with probability at least p if it exists, otherwise 'False'.
# Probability for one try finding the existing majority element is at least:
# Probability that m tries all fail (assuming a majority element exists) is at most:
def getMajorityRandomized(L, p):
    m = getMajorityBoyerMoore(L)
    # here we compute the freq of majority element
    num = 0
    for i in range(len(L)):
        if L[i] == m:
            num += 1
    freq = num / len(L)
    # with the formula we have freq^times >= p then times >= log(p)/log(freq)
    times = 0
    if p > 0 and freq != False:
        times = int(log(p) / log(freq))
    # apply the randomized algorithm
    for i in range(times):
        if getMajorityBoyerMoore(L) != m:
            return False
    return m


# Question 6 Answer
"""
1. For the as least probability that randomized approach
We assume that the frequency of majority is 1/2, which means there are n/2 majority appears in the list.
by uniform random selection which we have the probability to get the right majority P >= 1/2 since the number of majority is at least n/2

2. at most the probability that m â‰¥ 1 independent tries of this randomized approach all incorrectly return False
For the similar reason, for a single trial the probability of failed is P<=1/2
Since all the m times trials are independent, therefore we have P(m times all falied) <= (1/2)^m
Then the at most probability is (1/2)^m
