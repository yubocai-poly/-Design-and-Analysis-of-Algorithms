# Question 9 Answer
"""
Since we have to view all the element in the list, the list is with length n. And for each node
we have a probability 1/n that whether we flip or not. Therefore if we assume the the length of n
is large enough, we have the expectation number for 1 element that flip by the Law of Large number 
theorem. as n tend to infinity, we have E[number of flip] = n * 1/n = 1 by large number theorem.
