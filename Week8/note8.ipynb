If $r_1 \\neq r_2$, then the link operation does not change any of the ranks; the size of the subtree of the root with the smaller rank is unchanged and the other one is increased, so that the property is preserved. If $r_1=r_2$ then one of the nodes becomes the child of the other one and keeps its rank and subtree.
